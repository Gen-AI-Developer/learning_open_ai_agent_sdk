### Introduction to Open AI Agent SDK
The Open AI Agent SDK, introduced by OpenAI, is a tool for developers to create AI agents that can perform tasks autonomously. These agents can use tools, make decisions, and even delegate tasks, making it ideal for building intelligent applications. This guide will walk you through the process step by step, ensuring you can follow along even with limited technical background.

### Step-by-Step Guide
Here’s how to get started with the Open AI Agent SDK, divided into clear components:

#### 1. Installation and Setup
First, install the SDK using pip:
- Run `pip install openai-agents` in your terminal.
- Set your OpenAI API key by exporting it as an environment variable: `export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key`. This key is essential for accessing OpenAI’s models.

#### 2. Defining Tools
Tools are Python functions that your agent can call to perform specific tasks, like getting the weather. Decorate these with `@function_tool` to make them usable.
- Example:
  ```python
  from agents import function_tool

  @function_tool
  def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
      return f"The weather in {city} is sunny"
  ```

#### 3. Creating an Agent
An agent is an LLM (like ChatGPT) configured with instructions and tools. Use the `Agent` class to set it up.
- Example:
  ```python
  from agents import Agent

  agent = Agent(
      name="Weather agent",
      instructions="Answer weather questions using the get_weather tool",
      model="o3-mini",
      tools=[get_weather],
  )
  ```
- Note: The model "o3-mini" is an example; check [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) for available models.

#### 4. Running the Agent
To run the agent, define a context (like a dictionary with the task) and use the `Runner` class.
- Example:
  ```python
  from agents import Runner

  context = {"task": "What's the weather in New York?"}
  runner = Runner()
  result = runner.run(agent, context)
  print(result)
  ```
- The context can include any additional information the agent needs, making it flexible for different tasks.

#### 5. Advanced Features: Handoffs and Guardrails
- **Handoffs**: Allow agents to delegate tasks to other agents. For instance, create a second agent and use a handoff tool to pass tasks.
  - Example:
    ```python
    from agents import Agent, handoff_tool

    agent_two = Agent(
        name="Handoff agent",
        instructions="Perform specific tasks",
        model="o3-mini",
        tools=[],
    )

    @handoff_tool
    def delegate_to_handoff_agent(task: str) -> str:
        return agent_two.run(task)

    agent_one.tools.append(delegate_to_handoff_agent)
    ```
- **Guardrails**: Validate inputs before processing. Define a guardrail function to check inputs.
  - Example:
    ```python
    from agents import guardrail

    @guardrail
    def validate_input(input_str: str) -> bool:
        return len(input_str) > 0

    agent.guardrails.append(validate_input)
    ```

#### 6. Debugging with Tracing
The SDK includes tracing to visualize and debug workflows, which is unexpectedly helpful for monitoring complex agent interactions.
- Example:
  ```python
  from agents import Tracing

  tracing = Tracing()
  runner = Runner(tracing=tracing)
  result = runner.run(agent, context)
  ```

### Survey Note: Detailed Exploration of Open AI Agent SDK

This section provides a comprehensive breakdown of the Open AI Agent SDK, expanding on the direct answer with detailed insights and examples, mimicking a professional article. The SDK, as of recent documentation, is a production-ready upgrade from OpenAI’s previous experimentation, Swarm, and is designed for building agentic AI apps with minimal abstractions.

#### Background and Context
The Open AI Agent SDK was introduced to streamline the development of AI agents capable of autonomous, multi-step tasks. Documentation from [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/) highlights its lightweight nature, leveraging Python for orchestration. It’s particularly noted for its ability to integrate with tools like web search and APIs, as seen in articles like [Building AI Agents with OpenAI Agents SDK](https://medium.com/@sahin.samia/building-ai-agents-with-openai-agents-sdk-a-step-by-step-guide-5f1a4f1133b3).

#### Core Components and Layered Approach
The SDK is built around several key primitives, which can be understood layer by layer:

- **Agents**: These are the core building blocks, essentially LLMs equipped with instructions and tools. For instance, an agent might be instructed to “always respond in haiku form” and use a weather tool, as shown in the example:
  ```python
  from agents import Agent, ModelSettings, function_tool

  @function_tool
  def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
      return f"The weather in {city} is sunny"

  agent = Agent(
      name="Haiku agent",
      instructions="Always respond in haiku form",
      model="o3-mini",
      tools=[get_weather],
  )
  ```
  The model parameter, like “o3-mini,” specifies which LLM to use, and tools are functions the agent can call.

- **Tools**: Any Python function can be turned into a tool with `@function_tool`, automatically generating schemas and using Pydantic for validation. This is a significant feature, allowing developers to extend agent capabilities easily. For example, a tool might retrieve files or call external APIs, enhancing agent functionality beyond simple responses.

- **Handoffs**: These enable task delegation between agents, crucial for complex workflows. For example, one agent might handle weather queries, while another specializes in language translation, passing tasks via handoff tools. An example workflow might involve routing tasks based on language, as seen in repository examples like [routing.py](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/blob/main/examples/agent_patterns/routing.py).

- **Guardrails**: These ensure input validation, breaking early if checks fail. This is vital for maintaining reliability, especially in production environments. An example guardrail might check if an input string is non-empty:
  ```python
  from agents import guardrail

  @guardrail
  def validate_input(input_str: str) -> bool:
      return len(input_str) > 0
  ```
  Guardrails can include tripwires, as noted in examples like [input_guardrails.py](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/blob/main/examples/agent_patterns/input_guardrails.py).

- **Agent Loop and Tracing**: The SDK includes a built-in agent loop for handling tool calls and decision-making, looping until tasks are complete. Tracing, another unexpected detail, allows visualization and debugging, supporting external tools like Logfire and Braintrust. This is particularly useful for evaluating and fine-tuning models, as mentioned in [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/).

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
To implement the SDK, follow these steps, each with examples:

1. **Installation**: Install via `pip install openai-agents`, as noted in [Medium Article](https://medium.com/@sahin.samia/building-ai-agents-with-openai-agents-sdk-a-step-by-step-guide-5f1a4f1133b3). Ensure you have Python and pip set up.

2. **API Key Setup**: Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` as an environment variable, crucial for authentication with OpenAI’s services.

3. **Defining Tools**: Create functions like `get_weather`, decorated with `@function_tool`, to enable agent interaction. This leverages Python’s flexibility, as seen in [Agents Documentation](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/agents/).

4. **Creating Agents**: Use the `Agent` class, specifying name, instructions, model, and tools. The model choice, like “o3-mini,” affects performance, and instructions guide behavior, such as responding in haiku.

5. **Running Agents**: Use `Runner.run()` with a context object, which can be a dictionary containing the task. For example:
   ```python
   from agents import Runner

   context = {"task": "What's the weather in New York?"}
   runner = Runner()
   result = runner.run(agent, context)
   ```
   The context serves as a dependency injection, passing state to agents and tools, enhancing flexibility.

6. **Advanced Features**: Implement handoffs for task delegation, guardrails for input validation, and tracing for debugging. Examples in the repository, like [deterministic.py](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/blob/main/examples/agent_patterns/deterministic.py), show deterministic flows, while [parallelization.py](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/blob/main/examples/agent_patterns/parallelization.py) demonstrates running multiple agents concurrently.

#### Example Patterns and Use Cases
